# Dionysus

Dionysus is a Smash Ultimate plugin that adds content instead of replacing a
slot. Its Clone Engine adds fighters, items, stages and enemies of their own,
each built on a vanilla one. Dionysus also adds modes and menus, and Mii hats
and outfits.

Game version 13.0.4 or 13.0.5. Dionysus detects the version at boot.
`sd:/ultimate/dionysus/config.toml` can name it instead:

```toml
game_version = "auto"
```

`auto`, `13.0.4` or `13.0.5`. A wrong value is logged and the detected
version is used. The other plugins must match the game: ARCropolis 4.0.8
runs only on 13.0.4, 4.1.x only on 13.0.5, and Smashline needs 1.6.7 or
newer on 13.0.5. Smashline 2.0 runs only on 13.0.5; with it, the engine
registers articles through Smashline's `clone_weapon`, so weapon kinds are
shared with other mods. Plugins built for Smashline 1.x `clone_weapon` crash
a 2.0 boot until they are rebuilt.

## What you need

- Skyline and ARCropolis, the usual mod loaders
- Smashline
- NRO Hook
- The CSK Collection, which adds the character and stage select entries
- ParamConfig, optional but recommended, for changing fighter stats

## Install

Put Dionysus in the global plugin folder of your SD card:

```text
atmosphere/contents/01006A800016E000/romfs/skyline/plugins/libssbu_dionysus.nro
```

Smashline (`libsmashline_plugin.nro`) goes in the same folder.

Updating from Clone Engine: delete `libssbu_clone_engine.nro` from that
folder. The two cannot run together: with both installed, Dionysus says so and
closes the game. Its settings move from `sd:/ultimate/clone_engine/` to
`sd:/ultimate/dionysus/` on the first boot; the old folder is left as it was.

The `Dionysus Modes` folder from the release goes under `ultimate/mods/`:
it is the modes page, where packs that add modes of their own list them (X
on the main menu; see docs/wiki/MENUS.md).

Every mod pack goes in its own folder under `ultimate/mods/`. If a pack has
code, that code is a `plugin.nro` inside the pack's own folder, never in the
global plugin folder.

The first boot writes `sd:/ultimate/dionysus/settings.toml`:

```toml
gliding = true
```

`false` turns off the glide that packs get from the engine, for use with
another glide mod.

## A fighter

The plugin registers the fighter, then keeps its CSK, ParamConfig and
Smashline calls as they were; only the names change:

```rust
use dionysus_api::v2::{fighter, Manifest};

fighter!(MY_FIGHTER, "my_fighter"); // the handle, and the identity

#[skyline::main(name = "my_fighter")]
pub fn main() {
    let manifest = Manifest::new(
        "my_fighter", // name: files under fighter/my_fighter, Smashline agent name
        "mario",      // base: the vanilla fighter it behaves like
    )
    .costumes(8)
    .own_css();       // the CSK call below publishes the select entry
    let Ok(kind) = MY_FIGHTER.register(manifest) else { return };

    add_chara_db_entry_info(CharacterDatabaseEntry {
        ui_chara_id: hash40("ui_chara_my_fighter"),                                 // ui_chara_<name>
        fighter_kind: Hash40Type::Overwrite(hash40("fighter_kind_my_fighter")),      // fighter_kind_<name>
        fighter_kind_corps: Hash40Type::Overwrite(hash40("fighter_kind_my_fighter")),
        ..
    });
    param_config::update_float(kind, vec![-1], (hash40("param_special_hi"), hash40("y_spd_air")), 1.5); // the clone's kind, every costume
    smashline::Agent::new("my_fighter")                                              // scripts under the clone's own name
        .game_acmd("game_attack11", game_attack11, smashline::Priority::Default)
        .on_line(smashline::Main, fighter_frame)
        .install();
}
```

A pack with no code declares the same thing in a `fighter.toml` next to its
`config.json`, and the engine publishes the select entry:

```toml
name = "my_fighter"        # your files live under fighter/my_fighter
base = "mario"             # the vanilla fighter it behaves like
display_name = "My Fighter"
costumes = 8
series = "mario"
```

Start from [custom_fighters/template_v2](custom_fighters/template_v2/).
Packs written before `fighter.toml`, where the plugin registers the fighter
itself, keep working; that form is documented in
[docs/DEPRECATED.md](docs/DEPRECATED.md).

## Numbers are not yours to pick

The engine assigns every kind and id at boot, and they change with the
player's other mods. Use your name (`my_fighter`) everywhere; never write a
number into a file name or a config.

## Clone Pack Workbench

[Clone Pack Workbench](https://github.com/PropaSmike/clone_pack_workbench)
builds the pack itself: it writes `config.json`, `fighter.toml`, `item.toml`
and `stage.toml`, and checks a pack before you install it. Start there for a
pack without code.

## Templates

| Template | What it shows |
|---|---|
| [Fighter](custom_fighters/template_v2/) | Registration by code, a capability check, the CSK select entry, ParamConfig and engine stats, a Smashline moveset, an article with its own scripts and ParamConfig behaviours, a Kirby copy with its own motions, article and scripts, and slot, common, copy and offset hooks |
| [Item](custom_items/template_v2/) | Registration by code, a capability check, a pack skeleton, a status, common and owner parameters, natural drops, item and common vtable hooks, and a boss family with its members (`KIND_AUTO`) |
| [Stage](custom_stages/template/) | A stage with normal, Omega and Battlefield forms and a stage select entry, moving platforms, paused model motions, ladders, barrel cannons, springs and a door the plugin opens |
| [Enemy](custom_enemies/template/) | A clone of Nabbit with its own logic, brought into every battle on any stage |
| [Menu](custom_menus/template/) | Modes on the modes page: a gauntlet of battles with team swaps, a custom pause row, music, HUD layouts and a boss on the boss bar; the game's boss battle; a mode without select screens; a movie screen; main menu codes and patches |

The long-form API is in [DEPRECATED.md](docs/DEPRECATED.md). Its templates
are retired; the ones above show everything they did.

## What Dionysus handles

- fighters: identity, files, character select entry, colours, effects,
  sounds, camera, CPU behaviour, stats, Final Smash backgrounds
- articles (a fighter's projectiles and objects), with Kirby copy support
- items: files, settings, scripts, statuses, Training menu cell, drops
- item families: Assist Trophies, Pokemon and bosses
- enemies: Ultimate's stage enemies on any stage, and new enemy kinds made
  from them
- stages: identity, forms, stage select entry and paging, collision,
  settings, music
- menus: main menu buttons, modes, battles started from a menu
- several packs changing the same game function at once

## Using the API in your plugin

```toml
[dependencies]
dionysus_api = { git = "https://github.com/PropaSmike/ssbu_dionysus", tag = "<release>" }
```

Use the tag of the Dionysus release you installed. Releases from before the
rename name the crate `clone_engine_api`.

## Building Dionysus

```sh
cargo skyline build --release
```

Features named `research_*`, `diag_*` or `selftest_*` are left out of release
builds.
